## What is Software Quality?

Software quality refers to the degree to which a software system meets:
âœ” Functional Requirements â€“ Does it work as expected?
âœ” Non-Functional Requirements â€“ Is it secure, scalable, and maintainable?
âœ” User Expectations â€“ Does it provide a great experience?

Good software should be reliable, efficient, maintainable, and secure, ensuring a seamless experience for users and developers.
Key Attributes of Software Quality:

ðŸ”¹ Reliability â€“ Consistent performance under different conditions.
ðŸ”¹ Performance â€“ Fast response times and efficient resource usage.
ðŸ”¹ Security â€“ Protection against threats and vulnerabilities.
ðŸ”¹ Maintainability â€“ Easy to update, fix, and enhance over time.
ðŸ”¹ Usability â€“ Intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## What is Software Value?

Software value is about delivering meaningful benefits to users and businesses. High-value software doesnâ€™t just workâ€”it solves real problems efficiently and aligns with business goals.
How to Measure Software Value:

ðŸ’¡ Business Impact â€“ Does it improve efficiency, reduce costs, or generate revenue?
ðŸ’¡ User Satisfaction â€“ Are users happy and engaged?
ðŸ’¡ Competitive Advantage â€“ Does it differentiate the company from competitors?
ðŸ’¡ Scalability â€“ Can it grow with the business?

High-value software prioritizes customer needs, long-term sustainability, and return on investment (ROI).
